# about this project 
 a system with three connective sections: web scraping, parsing and analysis API. These three sections work together for users to automatically crawl target data from webpages, reading and writing from local databases, providing 42 APIs for users to analysis. APIs include unit conversion, calculating linear and polynomial regression, compiling statistics of players, coaches, team and game log data. Among that 42 APIs, we also support 22 visualization functions, allowing users to directly view the results. The design architecture of our tool allows easy extension and diversity. We expect that our tool can be extended to conduct multi-areas data mining analysis research.
